<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Refuse `git commit` and `git push` while HEAD is the default branch.

.DESCRIPTION
    main advances only through a reviewed PR rebase. Work belongs on a
    type/short-slug branch; see CLAUDE.md.

    This exists because the written rule alone was not enough: five commits
    landed directly on main in one session before anyone noticed. A hook
    notices every time.

    Reads a Claude Code PreToolUse payload on stdin and, when it decides to
    block, prints a permissionDecision of "deny" with a reason.

    Fails OPEN. If the payload will not parse, or git cannot report a branch,
    the command is allowed. A guard that blocks all shell work when it misfires
    is worse than the problem it solves.
